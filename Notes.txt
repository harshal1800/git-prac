### **Git & GitHub: Simple Guide**  

#### **What is Git?**  
Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code, helping developers collaborate and manage projects efficiently.  

#### **What is GitHub?**  
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling collaboration, version control, and project management.  

---

### **Key Git Concepts:**  
- **Repository (Repo):** A storage for code and its history.  
- **Commit:** Saving changes in Git.  
- **Push:** Sending local commits to GitHub.  
- **Pull:** Fetching updates from GitHub to your local system.  
- **Branch:** A separate version of the project for new changes.  
- **Merge:** Combining branches.  
- **git checkout -b :** command is used to create and switch to a new branch in one step.
- **git checkout branch-name :** command is used to switch to an existing branch in Git.
- **Clone:** Copying a repository from GitHub to your local system.  
- **Fork:** Creating a copy of someone’s repo in your GitHub account.  
- **Staging Area:** A space where changes are prepared before committing.  
- **Remote Repository:** A Git repository stored on a server (like GitHub).  
- **Fetch:** Downloading changes from a remote repo without merging.  
- **Rebase:** Moving or combining commits in a different branch.  
- **Reset:** Undo changes by moving back to a previous commit.  
- **Cherry-Pick:** Applying specific commits from one branch to another.  
- **Gitignore:** A file that tells Git which files to ignore (e.g., logs, env files). 
- **ls :	Lists all visible files and directories in the current folder.
- **ls -a:	Lists all files, including hidden ones (files starting with . like .git).

### **Key GitHub Features:**  
- **Issues:** Used to track bugs or feature requests.  
- **Pull Requests (PR):** A way to propose changes before merging them.  
- **Actions:** Automate workflows, like testing or deployment.  
- **Wiki:** Documentation space inside a GitHub repository.  
- **Projects:** A Kanban-style board for task management.  

*************************

Run the following commands to configure Git with your local Machine:  

git config --global user.name "harshal1800"
git config --global user.email "harshalchavhank18@gmail.com"


To verify the configuration, run:  
git config --global --list


********************

# Git Workflow

# 1. Whatever changes we make go to the staging area
git add .

# 2. After that, we commit those changes (save them locally)
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# 3. Then, we push those changes to our remote repository (GitHub)
git push origin main  # Use 'main' or 'master' depending on your branch

********************

# 1. Check the status of your repository
git status  

# 2. Stage changes (move files to the staging area)
git add .  # Stages all changes
# OR
git add filename  # Stages a specific file

# 3. Commit changes (save them locally)
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# 4. Push changes to the remote repository (GitHub)
git push origin main  # Use 'main' or 'master' depending on your branch

# 5. Pull latest changes from remote (if needed)
git pull origin main  # Sync your local repo with GitHub

# 6. Clone a repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

# 7. View Git history
git log  # Shows commit history

************************

The git log : command shows the history of commits in your repository.

U : Untracked file
M : Modified file

***************
```sh
# Undo last commit but keep changes staged
git reset --soft HEAD~1  

# Undo last commit and unstage changes (default)
git reset HEAD~1  

# Undo last commit and delete all changes permanently (⚠ irreversible)
git reset --hard HEAD~1  

# Unstage changes (after `git add .`)
git reset HEAD  
```

***************************

### **Add a Local Project to a Remote GitHub Repository**  

Follow these steps to push your local project to GitHub:  

```sh
# 1. Navigate to your project folder
cd your-project-folder  

# 2. Initialize Git (if not already initialized)
git init  

# 3. Add all files to the staging area
git add .  

# 4. Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"  

# 5. Add the remote repository (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git  

# 6. Push the project to GitHub
git push -u origin main  # Use 'main' or 'master' depending on your branch
```

***************************

### **Branching and Merging in Git**  

#### **1️⃣ Create a New Branch (Branching)**  
```sh
git branch branch-name   # Create a new branch
git checkout branch-name # Switch to the new branch
# OR (shortcut)
git checkout -b branch-name
```

#### **2️⃣ View All Branches**  
```sh
git branch
```

#### **3️⃣ Merge a Branch into `main` (Merging)**  
```sh
git checkout main       # Switch to main branch
git merge branch-name   # Merge the branch into main
```

#### **4️⃣ Delete a Branch**  
```sh
git branch -d branch-name  # Delete the branch (if merged)
git branch -D branch-name  # Force delete (even if not merged)
```

******************

git branch                    # List branches
git checkout -b feature1       # Create and switch to 'feature1'
git branch                     # Check branches
git checkout main              # Switch back to main
git branch                     # Check branches
git checkout -b feature2       # Create and switch to 'feature2'

# (Make changes in feature2)
git branch                     # Check branches
git status                      # Check changes
git add .                       # Stage changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"  # Commit changes
git push origin feature2        # Push 'feature2' to remote

git checkout main               # Switch back to main
git branch                      # Check branches

# ✅ Correct way to merge
git merge feature2              # Merge 'feature2' into 'main'
git push origin main            # Push updated main to remote

### **Git Merge Conflict (Theory)**  

A **merge conflict** occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from two branches because the same part of a file has been modified differently in both branches.  

#### **Causes of Merge Conflicts**  
1. Two people change the same line in a file on different branches.  
2. A file is deleted in one branch but modified in another.  
3. Conflicting changes exist in multiple commits.  

#### **How to Resolve a Merge Conflict?**  
1. **Identify conflicts** using `git status`.  
2. **Manually edit the conflicted files** to remove merge markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).  
3. **Stage the resolved files** using `git add filename`.  
4. **Commit the merge** with `git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"`.  
5. **Push the changes** to update the remote repository.  

✅ **Merge conflicts require manual resolution because Git doesn’t know which changes to keep.** 🚀

### merge conflict done by me :
git branch (main : here i done some changes in same line)
git status (it will show modifined files in red color)
git add .
git status (it will show modifined files in green color)
git commit -m "added main branch"
git checkout feature2 (here i changed the branch and done some changes on the same line i have done in main)
git status (it will show modifined files in red color)
git add .
git commit -m "added feature2"
git diff main (it will ceck diff between main and feature2)
git merge main (it will merge main into feature2)
git status
(it will show you which change you want the you have to select any one )
git add .
git commit -m "resolve merge conflict"
git push origin feature2
git checkout main (switch to main)
git diff feature2
git merge feature2
git status
git push
